# Task Prompt

Edit this file to customize what Claude Code does in each session.

---

Your job is to port ACE framework (Python) to TypeScript and maintain the repository.

You have access to source/ (Python) and target/ (TypeScript git repo).

Make a commit after every single file edit.

Use .agent/ directory as scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.

Key substitution: LiteLLM (Python) → Vercel AI SDK (TypeScript)

The .env file contains API keys for running examples.

Spend 80% of time on porting, 20% on testing. When porting is complete, improve code quality and fix any issues.
